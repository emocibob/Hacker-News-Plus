# Hacker News Plus

A web extension to enhance the Hacker News comment section.

## Features

This extension adds links to all parent comments for each comment.
You can hover over the links to see the content of those comments.

The parent links start with 1 (which is the highest parent in the comment thread) while the sequent numbers follow the thread up to the current comment.
